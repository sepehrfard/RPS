Done:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Video feed centered and video hidden only canvas shows with bounding box.

2. Bounding box area is only sent to the server for prediction

3. Classifer correctly predicts however very slow, look into timed detection to 
take load off of model classifing too many frames. 

4. prediction sent to client

5. corresponding emoji is highlighted with hand prediction, timing a little off 

Things to do:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - cant get the timer to work correctly with the reponses of prediction 
    - look into correctly writing promise to reset countdown 
    - some how need to reset from finding correct detections

2 - leader board
